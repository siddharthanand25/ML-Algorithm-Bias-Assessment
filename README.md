# ML-Algorithm-Bias-Assessment
## Algorithm Bias
### Objective

The objective of this project is to assess the impact of algorithm bias on machine learning algorithms trained with imbalanced data.
Submissions should also propose and evaluate strategies for overcoming this bias.

Load the Survival dataset and assess the bias of classifiers trained on this dataset, i.e. are classifiers biased towards the majority class.

I'll be comparing hold-out testing and cross-validation techniques to analyze the Bias generated by different Machine Learning Alogrithms k-NN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting.

I'll be showing the count of Majority and Minority class after splitting the data into training and test sets, and thus will comparing how different ML models are predicting the count of minority classes. If the models are not predicitng accurately the count of miority classes then we can assure that there is Algorithm Bias
